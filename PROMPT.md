# Pokémon Higher Or Lower

This app is a Vue game that replicates the famous Higher or Lower (from `https://www.higherlowergame.com/`).

You are first able to select what aspect of Pokémon you want to distinguish the higher or lower, like Size or Weight.

An initial Pokémon is displayed with it's name, Sprite and the value to guess for on the left and on the right you see the name and Sprite of the next Pokémon to give your higher or lower guess to. If you are correct, you score a point, if you are wrong, the game is over and your final game is shown. The game is visually pleasing.

This app is bi-lingual and supports German or English.

The app uses shadcn-vue & @pkmn/dex, see the already implemented selectors (dex-util.ts).
